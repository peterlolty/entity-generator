                              MODEL ENTITIES
                              ==============


Introduction
------------
The Model Entities module provides a fully working yet generic example about
what is good practice in creating and administering entities and integrating
entities with the rest of Drupal Core and the Drupal ecosystem.

It is also a way to quickstart your entities development as the code can
directly be used in your own project.

As mentioned the code tries to remain as generic as possible so as to not to
distract away from the main issue and allow you to literally copy and paste into
your own project.

This module does not provide any functionality to non-developers.


Installation
-------------
Once you activate the module it sets up an entity administration interface under
Admnistration > Structure > Modelentity Types

You can add model_modelentity entities via Administration > Content > Modelentities

Keep in mind that you need to create some Modelentity Types before you can add
entities.


Using the code in your projects
-------------------------------
The way I envision using the module in my own projects is, for the time being,
searching and replacing the word "model" with the actual name I want to give my
entity and the base entity table and then adding the domain specific
functionality.

It would be nice if this could eventually develop in something that is automated
so via a drush script we can get all the code ready to go.


Customising your entities in 5 simple steps.
--------------------------------------------
1. Search and replace in all files:
- "model_modelentity" by the name of your entity (and "Modelentity" and the plural
forms "model_modelentities" and "Modelentities")
- "model" by the name of your module (and "Model" with uppercase)

2. Rename all files of the module as in the first step

3. Customize your table in module.install by adding any column tables specific
to your entity.

Your would only every really need to change the Modelentity entity and
Modelentity type. ModelentityType is simply there to provide a means to
represent your different entity bundles.

Also keep in mind that if you can get away with adding data only in serialized
form in the data column you can avoid doing anything to the tables.

4. Customize the edit form for your entity
Which you will find in model_modelentity.admin.inc and customize the behaviour
of your entity on save, delete which you do via the ModelentityController class
in model.module.

Currently, I am overwriting the create function to add some extra info. If you
stick to the $data variable and save extra data in serialized form (and not
adding new columns to your table)  - just like the model_modelentity entity does with
the checkbox - there is nothing else you need to do. If you have added new
columns you need to add support for them in $model_modelentity->create but not
necessarily $model_modelentity->save unless you are doing something specific.

5. Finally you can play around within the theming for your entity by looking
into model_modelentity.tpl.php and model_modelentity-sample-data.tpl.php
